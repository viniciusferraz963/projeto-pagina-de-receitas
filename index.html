            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Beat the eggs:</strong> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed.
                You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
               <br>
                <li><strong>Heat the pan:</strong> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Cook the omelette:</strong> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure
                the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Add fillings (optional):</strong> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the
                middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Fold and serve:</strong> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the
                fillings. Let it cook for another minute, thenslide it onto a plate.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Enjoy:</strong> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
            </ol>
